# test-helloword-raw

This time it is a plain web app use only servlet :)

The whole folder is a maven project, refernces pom.xml. Use mvn package order you can make it into a war.

I deleted the target folder and put the war file just under the project folder. Deploy it to server you can get a response like "hello world" at path "/test/hello".

A junit test case was added, but I decided to keep the old python file.

Sept 5 edit: I've reajust the project under the instruction.
